#ItemRelations (Omeka plugin)

##Description
This plugin is a fork of the ItemRelations plugin https://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/item-relations/

##Added functionalities :

- Improved relations display, with ordering by collections and relation types and hopefully intelligent indentation
- Object and Subject finding via autocomplete or relation creation
- Ability to limit available relations via admin interface
- Basic functionality for relations' label and description translation

##Installation and Upgrade

On a vanilla installation, just install as usual : copy this plugin's directory in Omeka's plugins/ directory.

If your site already uses ItemRelations, the plugin will do its best to upgrade it.

- Replace the plugins/ItemRelations directory with this one.
- Go to admin/plugins
- Click the 'Upgrade' button next to the module's name
